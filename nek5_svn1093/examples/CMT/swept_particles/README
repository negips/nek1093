MS102615 -  Swept particles in a triply periodic 3D domain.
    Each direction spans [-1,1]. Particles are randomly placed and 
    get advected at a prescribed velocity. User can prescribe the velocity 
    in useric by specifying a value for ux,uy and uz. Number of particles in
    the domian are specified ny nw in init_stokes_particles subroutine.
    Note that lpart in SIZE file needs to be big enough to accomodate all the
    particles.

    This version uses barycentric Largrange interpolation and modifications that
    reduce the number of particles passed to findpts call.

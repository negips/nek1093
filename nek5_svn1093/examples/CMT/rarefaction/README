BACKGROUND:

Two-dimensional box with walls on all sides but one, where there is a subsonic outflow.
One-dimensional rarefaction wave propagates into the domain, emptying it of its
calorically perfect gas. The
simulation is supposed to stop before the wave reaches the left wall, but I
appear to have made a miscalculation in usrdat2.

The code initializes the flow field to the solution of an initially quiescent
Riemann problem with a 100k-fold pressure jump at t=0.01=zerotime. zerotime
is NOT added to time in TSTEP. The usr file contains a minimally-edited copy
of e1rpex, the Riemann solver due to Toro (1997)

riemann.inp contains its inputs; please do not change xdiaph without
changing the domain; the outflow must lie no further than xdiaph until
we have shock capturing incorporated in CMT-nek AND a credible, related,
method of managing contact discontinuities.

As the wave propagates, userchk samples the solution to the Riemann problem
at the grid points along an x-profile taken at the middle of the domain in y.
L2 error with respect to this solution is computed and stored, unnormalized,
in fort.337. The profiles directory contains ASCII files of the exact
solution and CMT-nek's solution along the x-profile at the iostep steps.

Although the profile plots in *rarefaction.pdf do not show it unambiguously,
there are substantial Gibbs oscillations at the head and tail of the fan;
the flow is not smooth here (derivative jump), and the Lagrange polynomials
and their corresponding variational method will only converge linearly in nx1.
